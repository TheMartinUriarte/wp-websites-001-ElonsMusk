## Prompt
[WP] Elon Musk abandons SpaceX and Tesla and starts a new cologne line called "Elon's Musk"

--

"Always good to see you, Elon. Let's hear it!"

"Director, we've worked together on disrupting every industry," Elon begins. "Together, we've revolutionized online payments with Paypal. We've transformed transportation and energy with Tesla. We've changed how people get laid with our secret involvement in Tinder and Grindr. Now, the only thing left is..."

The Director's heart beats like a thousand drums. He looks around the secret bunker they are sitting in, a hundred feet below the SpaceX headquarters. Its walls are lined with Elon's latest inventions. The Director is certain that whatever's next, it is going to put him on the Forbes Top 10 list.

"... Cologne."

"That's amaz- Wait, what?"

"It's an industry ripe for disruption! We'll call it Elon's Musk, it's perfect-"

"What, no! We are not making perfume, for God's sake!"

"It's not perfume, my friend. It's cologne." Elon shakes his head, as he often does when people do not understand his vision for the world. How many companies will it take to prove that Elon is never wrong?

The director slams the table furiously. "Cologne perfume, tomato tomahto. I am not giving you a cent for this."

"My friend, it's not just any cologne. It's a solar-powered, AI-mediated scent carefully calibrated by big data, storing every user preference in the Cloud and delivering the perfect musk every time. And that's not even the best part..."

The Director leans forward curiously. "The best part?"

Elon smiles. "Mind control." With the reflexes of a billionaire genius playboy, he whips out a cologne bottle and sprays it at the Director.

All at once, the Director is overwhelmed by the brilliance that is Elon's mind. The world glows with the sparkle of a million Tesla solar roof tiles. The Director feels like a hundred SpaceX rockets have taken off at the same time and bathed him in the warm, everlasting embrace of Elon Musk.

He stares at Elon. That's the most beautiful man I've ever laid my eyes on, he thinks to himself. He feels his pants tighten a little.

"How much do you need?" he asks, dazed.

Elon leans back, a smug grin on his face. "Everything you've got, my friend."
